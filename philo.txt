* gcc -pthread

* pthread_t is the data type used to uniquely identify a thread.
It is returned by pthread_create() and used by the application in function calls
that require a thread identifier.
	
* The pthread_create() function starts a new thread in the calling process.
The new thread starts execution by invoking start_routine(); 
arg is passed as the sole argument of start_routine().

int pthread_create(pthread_t *restrict thread, const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr,
                          void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *restrict arg);


* The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling thread 
for (at least) usec microseconds.

* The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate.

* int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
 The pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by
       thread as detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its
       resources are automatically released back to the system without
       the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.
